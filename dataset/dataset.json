		"input": "",
		"output": "ECE's faculty is organized into 11 technical interest groups (TIGs) that collectively represent the major research thrusts of the School and technical interest areas of courses. These areas are highly interrelated, and many faculty members engage in research in multiple TIGs. Following is a brief description of each TIG, with a bulleted list of their major areas of research. \nBioegineering: Bioengineering applies engineering principles to study, manipulate, and control biological processes. In this area, mathematical, physical, and engineering concepts are developed and applied to solve problems in medicine and biology through hardware and software including electronics, sensors, engineering systems, data processing, computational imaging, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\nComputer Systems and Software: Computer Systems and Software creates novel computing environments for edge, cloud, and high-performance computing. Designs span low-power, reconfigurable microarchitectures to integrated hardware/software systems to large-scale distributed software and internetworked devices that communicate, learn, and intelligently adapt to the environment. Activities focus on optimizing cross-cutting characteristics, such as power/energy consumption, resiliency, and security.\nDigital Signal Processing: Digital Signal Processing (DSP) involves the representation, processing, modeling, and analysis of signals, information, and physical phenomena. DSP interprets the captured data and enables visualization, analysis, manipulation, and control. DSP lies at the core of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms.\nElectrical Energy: Electrical Energy is primarily concerned with meeting the demand for electric energy in a safe, reliable, secure, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly manner.\nElectromagnetics: Electromagnetics includes everything about radio waves: their generation, propagation, and interactions with materials, devices, and systems.\nElectronic Design and Applications: Electronic Design and Applications focuses on device and integrated circuit fabrication, circuit and system design and simulation, and instrumentation and testing techniques.\nNanotechnology: Nanotechnology is concerned with the emerging of enabling nano-scale materials and devices, including the design, analysis, and realization of enabling systems.\nOptics and Photonics: Optics and Photonics focuses on the exploitation of light waves and photons for communication, signal processing, imaging, sensing, computing, lighting, and energy harvesting.\nSystems and Controls: Systems and Controls is concerned with mathematical and computational techniques for modeling, estimation, and control of systems and processes.\nTelecommunications: Telecommunications focuses on the characterization, representation, transmission, storage, and networking of information over various media including space, optical fiber, and cable.\nVLSI Systems and Digital Design: VLSI Systems and Digital Design involves designing and testing complex digital and mixed-signal electronic systems. These techniques optimize power, performance, and reliability metrics across a wide range of applications."
